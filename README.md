# PythonListsSummaries
A set of pages summarizing discussion on major Python mailing lists.

## Project Motivation

The Python mailing lists are a real treasure trove with gems scattered here and there. Unfortunately, this mine of info lays hidden, buried as years pass by. 

- Reffering someone to a past question is a pain. You have to dig it out. 
- The reading format is a bit dated (the plain archive). 
- And ... good luck following the 112 messages to get the gist of the issue.

This project aims at providing rich articles summarising threads, a reference for the community! But, we need **your** help!

For how it started, please refer [here](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2019-March/056071.html) and [here](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2019-March/056123.html).
